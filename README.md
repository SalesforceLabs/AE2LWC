# AE2LWC

AE^2 is a set of LWCs that bring public data into our Salesforce customer 360.

This repository holds all the source code for the AE^2 Lightning Web Components, including tests.

We pull public information on accounts such as financials (number of employees, profit margins, annual revenue, and earnings) and display into an LWC based on ticker symbol.

In a separate card, we show executives & aggregate job listings by category.
